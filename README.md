# phylogenies_as_models
code for creating a js/shiny page for addressing NGSS cross cutting concept: Scale Proportion and Quantity (using models to study systems that are too large or too small), MS-LS4-Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity, HS-LS4-6 Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity

This uses https://github.com/veg/phylotree.js (so the javascript file is from them, stored here for convenience), and is based on their vanilla example.
